#  SCT_ML_1 - House Price Prediction

This repository contains Task 1 of the SkillCraft Machine Learning Internship. The goal of this task is to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on various input features.

##  Objective

To train a machine learning model using a dataset with housing features like area, number of rooms, location, etc., and predict the final house prices.

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy & Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- CSV file handling

##  Project Structure

- `train.csv`: Training dataset
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset
- `task1.py`: Script to train and evaluate the regression model
- `house_price_submission.csv`: Final submission of predicted prices
- `sample_submission.csv`: Format reference

##  Output

- Successfully trained a regression model
- Generated predictions for test data
- Exported results for submission
